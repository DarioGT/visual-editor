This is simple Django project. All what you need is syncdb and runserver.

This is demo of base for project for visual editing some diagrams and schemas.
I created this to use for one my idea, so it can do what I need and can\'t waht I don\'t need.
These are ExtJs with jQuery adapter and Rafael.
All values are in "inch". You can set in with context menu on canvas.
You can select item, create, edit, select multiple with CTRL.
You can group objects and select all group with SHIFT.
With right click on empty you can unselect items or exit from "Select target mode". 
Also you can drag-n-drop selected items.
And the main feature - you can catch bug!
